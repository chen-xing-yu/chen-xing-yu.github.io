This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

This paper presents a teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system, featuring a controllable variable-stiffness catheter that enhances stability and flexibility during transbronchial biopsies. The 7 DoF robotic system allows for translation, rotation, and bending of the bronchoscope; delivery and bending of the catheter; delivery and control of biopsy tools; as well as stiffness adjustment of the catheter, which adapts to the dynamic pulmonary environment to provide stable support during tissue sampling.
