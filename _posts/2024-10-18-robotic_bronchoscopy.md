This work presents a teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system, featuring a controllable variable-stiffness catheter that enhances stability and flexibility during transbronchial biopsies. The 7 DoF robotic system allows for translation, rotation, and bending of the bronchoscope; delivery and bending of the catheter; delivery and control of biopsy tools; as well as stiffness adjustment of the catheter, which adapts to the dynamic pulmonary environment to provide stable support during tissue sampling. 

## Robotic Bronchoscopy System with Variable-Stiffness Catheter for Pulmonary Lesion Biopsy



Robotic Bronchoscopy with Variable-Stiffness Catheter 

### System Overview

The system comprises a teleoperated surgical robot specifically designed for trans-respiratory diagnosis, incorporating a
three-stage design scheme that includes a bronchoscope, novel variable-stiffness catheters, and biopsy forceps, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. The robot is mounted on a 5 Degree of Freedom (DoF) passive robotic arm to achieve the appropriate angle of
intervention. Surgeons use tablets as the remote control system to teleoperate the three endoscopic instruments, inserting them
through the patient’s trachea and utilizing them for precise movements. Employing a multi-operator strategy, the robot
is controlled through a scheduling arrangement and weight distribution, allowing mentor surgeons and trainee surgeons to
observe the same surgical site and collaboratively control the surgical instruments simultaneously. Compared to the surgeon
console of the Da Vinci surgical robot, Force Dimension’s haptic devices [25], and other custom-made master control
units [10], this Human-Machine Interface (HMI) allows for quick integration of new features, making it convenient for
prototyping. However, it lacks physical feedback and cannot provide similar force feedback information, which may increase
the risk of operational hazards. Prolonged use of the touchscreen may also cause fatigue in the fingers or hands
of the surgeon. Additionally, there are security concerns in wireless environments. Future improvement will transfer the
control algorithm to a more ergonomic surgeon console.
